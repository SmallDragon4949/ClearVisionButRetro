# ClearVisionButRetro
The ClearVision BetterDiscord theme, but made retro, by just changing the background image.
That's all, I haven't changed the color scheme, I've just changed the background.
In order to use theme, turn on the normal ClearVision, then turn this on.

-NOTICE-
You will not be seing any more updates for this because of the fact I have swapped to
vencord which doesn't work the same as betterdiscord.
I may create another repository for vencord, but it's harder to make themes for vencord.
